# CG1111A-Maze-Solver
In this project, the robot needs to run through a maze in the shortest time. In addition, the robot cannot bump into any walls. This is achieved with the help of Ultrasonic Sensors and IR Sensors. At each Waypoint, the LDR Sensor wiill start operating and decode the colour of the paper on the maze and execute the correct action.
